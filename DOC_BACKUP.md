## Module 1: Creating Incidents

Learn how to automate ServiceNow incident creation using Ansible Automation Platform and the servicenow.itsm certified collection.

### Introduction
In ITIL, an incident refers to an unplanned outage or reduction in quality of an IT service or application. ServiceNow implements technology mapped to ITIL terminology and is accepted as an industry standard for incident management.
The servicenow.itsm certified collection allows organizations to leverage incident management within Ansible Automation Platform workflows, enabling:
    • Automated incident creation from monitoring systems
    • Standardized incident reporting processes
    • Integration with existing automation workflows
    • Consistent incident data structure and classification
Review the Playbook
A playbook has been created in the VS Code tab called incident-create.yml.
Example 1. Task: Inspect the playbook
    1. Open the VS Code tab in your lab environment
    2. Locate and open the incident-create.yml file
    3. Review the in-line comments to understand how the collection is being leveraged
    4. Pay attention to the module parameters and their purposes
Key elements to notice in the playbook:
    • How authentication is handled
    • Required and optional parameters for incident creation
    • How dynamic data is incorporated into the incident
Create Incident
Now you’ll execute the playbook through Automation Controller to create a ServiceNow incident.
Example 2. Procedure: Launch the job template
    1. Use the following login credentials access the Automation Controller tab
        ◦ Username: admin
        ◦ Password: ansible123!
    2. Navigate to Automation Execution > Templates
    3. Locate the 1 - Create incident (incident-create.yml) job template
    4. Click the rocket icon to launch the job
Monitor the job execution and note:
    • The job status and any output messages
    • The incident number created (you’ll need this for verification)
    • Any error messages or warnings
Inspect Results
Verify that the incident was successfully created in ServiceNow.
    • Username: aap-roadshow
    • Password: Ans1ble123!
Example 3. Procedure: Verify incident creation
    1. Use the ServiceNow credentials from your lab environment to access the ServiceNow tab
    2. In ServiceNow, select incidents
    3. Locate your newly created incident in the list
    4. Click on the incident to view its details
Verification Points
To confirm the incident was created by your automation:
    • Username: Your unique lab username should appear in the incident description
    • Incident Number: Should match the number displayed in the Automation Controller job output
    • Timestamp: Should correspond to when you ran the job
    • Status: Should be in "New" or "Active" state

Expected Results
You should see a new incident with: - A unique incident number (e.g., INC0012345) - Your lab username in the description - Appropriate priority and category settings - Timestamp matching your job execution
Next Steps
Once you’ve successfully created and verified your incident, you’re ready to move on to Module 2, where you’ll learn about problem management and how to attach problems to existing incidents.
Troubleshooting

Introduction
In ServiceNow’s ITIL implementation, a problem represents the underlying cause of one or more incidents. Problems are used to:
    • Identify root causes of recurring incidents
    • Prevent future incidents through permanent fixes
    • Track workarounds and known errors
    • Maintain relationships between incidents and their underlying causes
The root cause of a problem may not be known at creation time and often requires investigation through the problem management process.
Understanding Problem-Incident Relationships
Problems and incidents have a many-to-one relationship:
    • One problem can be associated with multiple incidents
    • Each incident can be linked to at most one problem
    • Problems help identify patterns and systemic issues
Review the Playbook
A new playbook called problem-attach.yml has been added to your VS Code workspace.
Example 1. Task: Inspect the problem creation playbook
    1. Open the VS Code tab in your lab environment
    2. Locate and open the problem-attach.yml file
    3. Review the playbook structure and logic
    4. Pay attention to how it queries for existing incidents
Key aspects to notice:
    • The playbook first queries for existing incident numbers you created
    • It uses the returned incident data in the problem creation task
    • The problem is automatically linked to the incident
    • Additional problem-specific fields are populated
Attach a Problem
Execute the playbook to create a problem and associate it with your existing incident.
Example 2. Procedure: Launch the problem attachment job
    1. Navigate to the Automation Controller tab
    2. Go to Automation Execution > Templates
    3. Locate the 2 - Attach problem (problem-attach.yml) job template
    4. Click the rocket icon (🚀) to execute the job
What Happens During Execution
The playbook performs these operations:
    1. Query Phase: Searches for incidents created by your user account
    2. Problem Creation: Creates a new problem record in ServiceNow
    3. Relationship Establishment: Links the problem to the identified incident
    4. Field Population: Sets appropriate problem details and categorization
Monitor the job output to see:
    • Which incident was found and selected
    • The problem number that was created
    • The relationship establishment between records
Inspect Results
Verify that the problem was created and properly linked to your incident.
Verify Problem Creation
Example 3. Procedure: Check the new problem
    1. Access the ServiceNow tab using your lab credentials
    2. Select the "Favorites" tab and select "Problem - assigned to me"
    3. Select the appropriate problems view
    4. Locate your newly created problem
Look for:
    • A new problem number (e.g., PRB0012345)
    • Your username in the problem description or assignment
    • Proper categorization and priority settings
    • Timestamp matching your job execution
Verify Incident Update
Example 4. Procedure: Check incident-problem relationship
    1. In ServiceNow, navigate to Self-service - Incidents
    2. Select your incident from Module 1
    3. Review the incident details for problem references
    4. Confirm the problem number appears in the related records
The incident should now show:
    • Updated status (if applicable)
    • Reference to the associated problem number
    • Modified timestamp reflecting the relationship update
Expected Relationship
Field
Expected Value
Incident Status
May be updated to "In Progress" or similar
Problem Reference
Should display the new problem number
Last Modified

The playbook uses several *_info modules that provide query capabilities:
    • servicenow.itsm.incident_info: Queries incident records
    • servicenow.itsm.problem_info: Searches problem records
    • servicenow.itsm.change_request_info: Finds change request records
These modules search for active records created by your username and return structured data for processing.
Data Transformation Process
The playbook demonstrates advanced Ansible techniques:
    1. Query Execution: Info modules retrieve relevant records
    2. Data Processing: Ansible transforms returned data into manageable lists
    3. Record Updates: Lists are passed to update modules for bulk processing
    4. Field Handling: Uses the other parameter for custom or non-standard fields
The 'other' Parameter
For fields not directly implemented by ServiceNow modules, the other parameter allows specification of:
    • Custom fields specific to your ServiceNow instance
    • Additional standard fields not covered by module parameters
    • Complex field values requiring special formatting
Query and Close Records
Execute the cleanup automation to systematically close all records created during the workshop.
Cleanup Execution
Example 2. Procedure: Launch the cleanup job
    1. Navigate to the Automation Controller tab
    2. Go to Automation Execution → Templates

        ◦ Problem records created by you
        ◦ Change requests under your name
    2. Validation Phase: Confirms records are appropriate for closure
        ◦ Verifies record ownership
        ◦ Checks current status eligibility
        ◦ Validates business rules compliance
    3. Processing Phase: Updates and closes identified records
        ◦ Updates incident status to "Resolved" or "Closed"
        ◦ Closes problem records with appropriate resolution
        ◦ Completes change requests with implementation status
    4. Reporting Phase: Provides summary of cleanup actions
        ◦ Lists all affected record numbers
        ◦ Reports success/failure status
        ◦ Documents any errors or exceptions
Expected Job Output
The job output should display:
    • Number of records found for each type (incidents, problems, changes)
    • Specific record numbers being processed
    • Status updates for each closure operation
    • Final summary of completed actions
Inspect Results
Verify that all workshop records have been successfully closed or removed from active status.
Verification Process
Example 3. Procedure: Confirm cleanup completion

Introduction
Throughout this workshop, you’ve explored various modules from the servicenow.itsm collection for automating incident management processes. While the examples demonstrated basic automation scenarios, these modules are highly flexible and can be adapted to numerous production use cases within ITSM.
Beyond ITSM Modules
The servicenow.itsm collection provides more than just ITSM task automation. One of its most powerful features is the dynamic inventory plugin that allows you to query endpoints directly from the ServiceNow CMDB.
Dynamic Inventory Benefits
Using ServiceNow as an Ansible inventory source provides:
    • Single Source of Truth: Eliminate duplicate inventory management
    • Real-time Data: Inventory updates automatically as CMDB changes
    • Rich Metadata: Leverage all CMDB attributes for targeting and grouping
    • Compliance: Ensure automation only targets authorized systems
    • Integration: Seamless connection between ITSM and automation workflows
Inventory Architecture
The ServiceNow inventory plugin:
    1. Queries CMDB: Retrieves configuration items based on filters
    2. Transforms Data: Converts CI data into Ansible inventory format
    3. Creates Groups: Organizes hosts by attributes (OS, manufacturer, location)
    4. Provides Variables: Makes CMDB fields available as host variables
    5. Updates Dynamically: Refreshes inventory data on demand
Current State
A new ServiceNow inventory has been pre-configured in Automation Controller, but it hasn’t synchronized with the CMDB yet. You’ll explore this inventory and trigger its first synchronization.
Review Inventories
Examine the current state of inventories in Automation Controller and understand the ServiceNow integration architecture.
Current Host Inventory
Example 1. Procedure: Check existing hosts
    1. Open the Automation Controller tab
    2. Navigate to Hosts in the left navigation pane
    3. Observe the current host list

Expected Observation
The host list appears empty or contains only the lab infrastructure hosts. This is expected because:
    • The ServiceNow inventory hasn’t been synchronized yet
    • The integration works API-to-API, not through individual host connections
    • Hosts will appear after ServiceNow CMDB synchronization
Understanding the Integration
The Ansible-ServiceNow integration architecture:
    • API Integration: Direct communication between Automation Controller and ServiceNow APIs
    • No Agent Required: Target systems don’t need Ansible agents or SSH access
    • CMDB as Source: ServiceNow CMDB serves as the authoritative inventory source
    • Dynamic Updates: Inventory refreshes based on current CMDB state
Sync ServiceNow Inventory
Trigger the ServiceNow inventory synchronization to populate Automation Controller with CMDB data.
Inventory Synchronization Process
Example 2. Procedure: Initiate inventory sync
    1. In Automation Controller, navigate to Inventories in the left navigation
    2. Locate and click on the ServiceNow inventory
    3. Select the Sources tab within the inventory details
    4. Click the Sync button (🔄) to initiate synchronization
What Happens During Sync
The synchronization process triggers multiple operations:
    1. API Query: Automation Controller queries ServiceNow CMDB using configured filters
    2. Data Retrieval: ServiceNow returns configuration items matching the criteria
    3. Data Processing: Raw CMDB data is transformed into Ansible inventory format
    4. Group Creation: Hosts are organized into groups based on attributes
    5. Variable Assignment: CMDB fields become available as host variables
Monitoring Sync Progress
Example 3. Procedure: Track synchronization jobs
    1. Navigate to Jobs in the left navigation pane
    2. Look for inventory sync jobs that were triggered
    3. Monitor job progress and status
    4. Review job output for any errors or warnings
The sync process may take a few minutes depending on:
    • Number of configuration items in the CMDB
    • Complexity of the inventory query
    • Network latency between systems
    • ServiceNow instance performance
Inspect Results
Examine the synchronized inventory data and understand how ServiceNow CMDB information appears in Automation Controller.
Verify Host Population
Example 4. Procedure: Check synchronized hosts
    1. Once the sync jobs complete, navigate to Hosts in the left navigation
    2. Observe the hosts that have been pulled from the ServiceNow CMDB
    3. Note the host names, groups, and associated metadata
Example 5. Procedure: Explore inventory details
    1. Go to Inventories → ServiceNow inventory → Hosts
    2. Review the imported hosts and their properties
    3. Examine the group memberships and organization
    4. Click on individual hosts to see their variables and metadata
Understanding Inventory Configuration
The ServiceNow inventory uses a specific configuration that demonstrates flexible querying:
# Group hosts automatically, according to values of manufacturer and os columns.
# Include only records with the specified operating systems.
# Groups will most likely overlap.
plugin: servicenow.itsm.now
group_by:
  manufacturer:
  os:
    includes:
      - Linux Red Hat
      - Windows XP
Configuration Breakdown
    • Plugin: Uses servicenow.itsm.now for CMDB integration
    • Filtering: Only includes specified operating systems (Linux Red Hat, Windows XP)
    • Grouping: Creates groups based on manufacturer and operating system
    • Overlapping Groups: Hosts may belong to multiple groups simultaneously
Expected Groups
The inventory configuration should create groups such as:
    • By Operating System: os_linux_red_hat, os_windows_xp
    • By Manufacturer: Groups based on hardware manufacturers
    • Combined Criteria: Intersection of OS and manufacturer attributes
Host Variables
Each host imported from ServiceNow includes variables derived from CMDB fields:
    • System specifications (CPU, memory, disk)
    • Network configuration (IP addresses, MAC addresses)
    • Software inventory (installed applications, patch levels)
    • Administrative data (asset tags, locations, owners)
Inventory Use Cases
This dynamic inventory enables powerful automation scenarios:
Targeted Automation
    • OS-Specific Tasks: Run playbooks only on specific operating systems
    • Hardware-Based Operations: Target actions based on manufacturer or model
